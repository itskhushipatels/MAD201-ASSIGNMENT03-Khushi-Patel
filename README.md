About the Movie Explorer App
This is a multi-page Flutter application developed to fulfill the requirements of Assignment 3 (MAD201). The app's primary objective is to demonstrate proficiency in core Flutter concepts by managing a collection of movies and a personalized favorites list.

Core Features Implemented
Multi-Screen Navigation: Implemented the required Bottom Navigation Bar (Home, Favorites, Profile) and a full Navigation Drawer (About, Contact).

Dynamic Data Display: Movies are listed using a dynamic ListView.builder with a reusable, custom movie tile widget.

State Management: Local state (setState()) is used to toggle the Favorite status on the detail screen, which dynamically updates the dedicated Favorites list.

Data Passing: Data for the selected movie is passed between the list screen and the detail screen for exploration.

Modular Design: The project adheres to best practices by organizing components into dedicated models/, screens/, and widgets/ directories.
